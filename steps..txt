mkdir client

mkdir api (for strapi)

cd client

npx create-react-app .

cleanup all the files in src folder except index.js and App.js

npm i react-router-dom

In src folder > create 3 new folders named

    Home, Products, Product

In Home > Home.jsx

In Products > Products.jsx

In Product > Product.jsx

And write rfc on each page



Now goto App.js and write import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom"; 

Use RouterProvider in App.js Like below

    
        function App() {
            return (
                <div>
                <RouterProvider router={router} />
                </div>
            );
        }

Import Home, Products, Product Pages in App.js

Now create router using createBrowserRouter

    const router = createBrowserRouter([
        {
            path: "/",
            element: <Home />,
        },
        {
            path: "/products/:id",  // :id is category id
            element: <Products />,
        },
        {
            path: "/product/:id",   // product id
            element: <Product />,
        },
    ]);

Create Components folder in src and In Components create Navbar and Footer folders.

In Navbar folder > Navbar.jsx

In Footer folder > Footer.jsx


Navbar and Footer will common in all pages. So, what we gonna do is Using "Outlet" from react-router-dom. Import Outlet

Create Layout 


    const Layout = () => {
        return (
            <div className="app">
            <Navbar />
            <Outlet />
            <Footer />
            </div>
        );
    };

Now we have to give this Layout to first element and give children as all these routes

    const router = createBrowserRouter([
        {
            path: "/",
            element: <Layout />,
            children: [
            {
                path: "/",
                element: <Home />,
            },
            {
                path: "/products/:id",
                element: <Products />,
            },
            {
                path: "/product/:id",
                element: <Product />,
            },
            ],
        },
    ]);
